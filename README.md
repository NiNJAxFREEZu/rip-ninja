# rip-ninja
Simple script for easy CD audio ripping.

## How it works?
Rips all the audio tracks from a CD into `.wav` files and then it converts them into 320kbps `.mp3` files.
Both `.wav` and `.mp3` files are saved into separate directories in ~/Music/ - just the way I like it.

## How to use it?
Simply put a CD into your CD-drive and launch the script.

## Dependencies
- cdparanoia (CD ripping)
- lame (`.wav` to `.mp3` conversion)
